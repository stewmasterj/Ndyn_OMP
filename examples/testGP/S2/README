 the kinetic energy per particle would be assumed to scale UP as the particle mass scales up.

But the kineitc energy is calculated as the particle's average kinetic energy,
 and if it supposed to represent implicit atoms then the particle's average kinetic energy
 would be less than its atoms, since the average velocity vector is less than the sum.

KEparticle = 1/2*(8*Matom)*(|sum(Vatoms)|)^2
  vs.
8*KEatom = 1/2*Matom*(avg(|Vatoms|))^2 

these are very not equal.
 since (|sum(Vatoms)|)^2 /= (avg(|Vatoms|))^2
the sum of atom velocity vectors would be less than their average magnitude

Thus a higher scale particle domain would be missing the representation of the atomic vibrations.

=======
In order for S2 to match S1, 
 the kinetic energy per particle must be 8x higher than S1
 the potential minimum, D0, must be 16x deeper and mass 16x than S1 to match material
  stiffness and wave speed,
  but D0 only 8x deeper and mass 8x greater to match S1 configuration energies and wave speed.
 the alpha parameter should be halved
 the r0 parameter doubled.
